ckanext-exampleform
===================

This is a simple example of a CKAN v1.8.1 extension that implements a custom 
form for CKAN 1.8.1

This project uses the Government of Canada theme 
(see https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew). It is assumed that this is 
installed separately in the ckanext/exampleform/public subdirectory.

The plugin to add to your ini file is "example_form".
